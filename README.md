# Disaster-Response-Pipeline
A machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.
This project was done as a part of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree.

# Project phases:

1. ETL (Extracting, transforming and loading the data), then preprocessing it before modeling.

2. Modeling the data to classify the disaster messages through ML and NLP pipelines.

3. Building a simple web app to visualize the results.

# Required packages and libraries:

- python3
- pandas
- sqlalchemy
- sklearn
- nltk
- re
- pickle
- flask
- plotly
